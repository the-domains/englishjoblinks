> Conversations With Foreigners is a popular non-profit English language center building capacity in Cambodia, providing affordable English classes to adult Khmer students from all walks of life. International volunteers teach conversational English in a fun, informal setting, with a student- centric, activity based style. Profits from student fees provide a sustainable source of core funding for development projects in rural Cambodia by our partner, the Cambodian Rural Development Team.
