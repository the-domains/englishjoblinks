Hello.

My name is Benjamin. I'm the owner/director of Benjamin English Club.

Due to fast growth in our numbers, we require extra teachers for Fridays only, for the early afternoon shift (approx 1pm to 5pm).

You are either a westerner with a famliy visa, or a gyopo with natural pronunciation. You will mainly be teaching young children, so an outgoing and light attitude will help. Your classes will be about 12 students, but could be as many as 20 in special cases.

On Fridays, we do special projects. Some months, we work on writing long sentences, on others we do a little English math, and on others, we take pictures and make online slideshows. With spring and summer coming, we may even make brief excursions outside. As you get used to the environment, you will be welcome to make suggestions of your own.

Due to the part-time nature of the job, the hourly rate will be much more than normal hagwon positions. The rate will be dependent on resume, on interviews, and on negotiations.

Please send resume/CV to:  
[beckorea@hotmail.com][0]

The title should include your name and purpose (i.e. "applying for Friday position)

If you like, you can see me and a couple of my students at benjamin-academy.com
